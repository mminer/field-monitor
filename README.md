Field Monitor is an editor extension for [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) (the game
engine) that allows you to view the values of fields and properties, both
static and ones in object instances. This can be useful for viewing changes to
values during play, e.g. the health of the player. This is similar to using the
Inspector to view the value of public fields, except you can view fields and
properties that are `static` or `private` or that don't belong to a
`MonoBehaviour`.

The package will be available for purchased and download from the Unity Asset
Store soon.
