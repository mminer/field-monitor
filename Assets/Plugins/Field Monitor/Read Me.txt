Field Monitor
=============

View values of fields and properties, both static and ones in object instances.
This can be useful for viewing changes to values during play, e.g. the health
of the player, that aren't exposed in the Inspector.


Getting Started
---------------

Specify which fields and properties to monitor by attaching the
FieldMonitor.Monitor attribute to them.

    [FieldMonitor.Monitor]
    static int playerHealth = 100;

    [FieldMonitor.Monitor]
    float timeAlive = 0.0;

In JavaScript the syntax is slightly different.

    @FieldMonitor.Monitor
    static var playerHealth = 100;

    @FieldMonitor.Monitor
    var timeAlive = 0.0;

If you wish to have all fields and properties in a class monitored, apply the
FieldMonitor.Monitor attribute to the class itself.

    [FieldMonitor.Monitor]
    class YourComponent : MonoBehaviour
    {
        static int playerHealth = 100;
        float timeAlive = 0.0;
    }

Now open the editor window by selecting the Window > Field Monitor menu item.
The window is divided into two tabs: Instance Members and Static Members. The
former shows values in instance objects (e.g. a component attached to a game
object) while the latter show static values. When running your game you will
see these values change accordingly.

A demo script is provided that shows how to integrate Field Monitor with your
scripts. Simply uncomment the first line in Plugins/Field Monitor/Demo.cs

You can control how often the Field Monitor window updates from Preferences.
By default, the values update when the window has focus or the mouse hovers
over it. However, you may wish for it to constantly repaint or only repaint
when the window it explicitly clicked on.


Limitations
-----------

Only fields and properties in instances that inherit from UnityEngine.Object
can be monitored. This includes MonoBehaviour scripts. For example, the field x
in the following class cannot be monitored.

    [FieldMonitor.Monitor]
    class SomeClass
    {
        int x;
    }


Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q: Does attaching the FieldMonitor.Monitor attribute to a field or property
   have any negative impact on my game?

A: No. The attribute is ignored by everything except for the Field Monitor
   editor extension. It's completely hardless once your game is deployed and
   when the Field Monitor window is closed.
